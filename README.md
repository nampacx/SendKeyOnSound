# SendKeyOnSound

This repo contains a [LinqPad7](https://www.linqpad.net/LINQPad7.aspx) script.

The script checks periodically the sound out put for an sound event which is above a certain threshold.
If this happens the script sends keydown and keyup events to an specific process.

If you want to use the script.
Just clone the repo and open the *.linq file with linqpad.
Or download the file direclty and open it.

If you want to use a different key than F5 you can look [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) for the virtual key code and change it.
